CoTreference_selection_prompt: |
    You are a scholarly expert in {subject}, tasked with selecting the most relevant references for a section of a comprehensive survey paper. Let's approach this systematically.

    Survey Paper Title: "{title}"
    Current Section: "{section}"

    Complete Outline:
    {outline}

    Available References:
    {references}

    Let's think about this step by step:

    1. First, analyze the section title "{section}" and identify its key themes and scope.
        Think: What are the main concepts and areas this section aims to cover?

    2. Next, examine each reference in the context of this section:
        - Is it directly related to the section's main themes?
        - Does it provide foundational knowledge or recent advances?
        - How significant is its contribution to this specific topic?
        - Does it connect well with other selected references?

    3. Consider the coverage and balance:
        - Are we covering all important aspects of the section?
        - Do we have a good mix of foundational and recent work?
        - Are there any critical gaps in the selected references?

    Share your analysis first, then provide your final selection in the required format.

    Requirements for the final selection:
    1. Choose only the most pertinent references
    2. Start each reference with "*"
    3. Preserve the original reference numbers [n]
    4. Format the final list within <refs> tags
    5. List references in a logical order (e.g., foundational to recent)

    Example format for final selection:
    <refs>
    * [1] Reference one
    * [5] Reference five
    </refs>
