In the present survey we discuss applications of Takács' asymptotic theorem and other related results in queueing theory, telecommunication systems and dams. Many of the results presented in this survey have appeared recently, and some of them are new. In addition, further applications of Takács' theorem are discussed.",

Most of these applications in\n[75] and following papers [76] – [84] are associated with an explicit application of a\ngeneralization of the ruin probability formula or its continuous analogue.\n\nThe ruin problems and ballot theorems have a long history and attract wide\nattention in the literature. The solution of the ﬁrst problems related to this subject\nhad been given in 1887 due to Bertrand [23] (see Sheinin [69] for the review of\nBertrand’s work). For other papers related to ballots problems, their generalizations\nand applications see [46], [47], [49], [54], [55], [57], [58], [82], [85], [87] and many\nothers.\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n3\n\nThe present survey is concerned with some special application of recurrence\nrelation (1.2), where there is no explicit application of the generalized gambler ruin\nproblem. In our application it does not matter what the meaning of values πj is,\nand what then the fraction Qk−i\nQk\n\nmeans.\n\nIn this survey we discuss applications of asymptotic Theorem 5 of Tak´acs [75]\nformulated on page 22 and the further asymptotic results on page 23 associated\nwith this theorem. We also use the other asymptotic results (Tauberian theorems\nof Postnikov which will be mentioned later). These asymptotic results develop\nthe aforementioned asymptotic theorem of Tak´acs [75] and are used in the paper\ntogether with Tak´acs’ theorem to accomplish it. Nevertheless, the title of this paper\nis supported by the fact that Tak´acs’ theorem serves as a tool to establish the main\nasymptotic properties of processes, while Postnikov’s Tauberian theorems improve\nand strengthen the results on that asymptotic behavior, when additional conditions\nare satisﬁed. In some delicate cases, applications of Postnikov’s Tauberian theorems\nhave especial signiﬁcance, when the case of Tak´acs’ theorem cannot help to establish\na required property.\n\nFor our convenience, we use the variant of Theorem 5 of [75] in combination with\n\nformula (35) on page 23 as follows. Denote\n\n∞\n\nℓ\n\nγℓ =\n\n(j − k + 1)πj .\n\nThe value γℓ characterizes the ℓth factorial moment related to the probabilities πj,\nj ≥ 0.\n\nXj=ℓ\n\nYk=1\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let π0 > 0. If γ1 < 1, then\n\nlim\nk→∞\n\nQk =\n\nQ0\n1 − γ1\n\n.\n\nlim\nk→∞\n\nQk\nk\n\n=\n\n2Q0\nγ2\n\n.\n\n(1.4)\n\nIf γ1 = 1 and γ2 < ∞, then\n\n(1.5)\n\nIf γ1 > 1, then\n\n(1.6)\n\nlim\nk→∞\n\nQk −\n\nQ0\nσk(1 − π′(σ))\n\n=\n\nQ0\n1 − γ1\n\n,\n\n(cid:21)\n\n(cid:20)\n\nwhere σ is the least nonnegative root of the equation z = π(z), and 0 < σ < 1.\n\nIn the case γ2 = ∞, [75] recommends to use the Tauberian theorem of Hardy\n\nand Littlewood [44], [43], which states that if\n\n1\n(1 − z)α+1 L\nas z ↑ 1, where α ≥ 0 and L(x) is a slowly varying function at inﬁnity (i.e. L(cx) ≍\nL(x) for any positive c as x → ∞), then\n\n1\n1 − z\n\nQ(z) ≍\n\n(cid:18)\n\n(cid:19)\n\n,\n\nQk ≍\n\nkα\nΓ(α + 1)\n\nL(k),\n\nas k → ∞, where Γ(x) is the Euler gamma-function.\n\nThe case γ1 = 1 and γ2 < ∞ has been developed by Postnikov [65], Sect. 25.\n\nHe established the following two Tauberian theorems.\n\n\n4\n\nVYACHESLAV M. ABRAMOV\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let π0 > 0. Suppose that γ1 = 1 and γ3 < ∞. Then, as k → ∞,\n\n(1.7)\n\nQk =\n\n2Q0\nγ2\n\nn + O(log n).\n\nTheorem 1.3. Let π0 > 0. Suppose that γ1 = 1, γ2 < ∞ and π0 + π1 < 1. Then,\nas k → ∞,\n\n(1.8)\n\nQk+1 − Qk =\n\n2Q0\nγ2\n\n+ o(1).\n\nThe applications reviewed in this survey are related to queueing theory, telecom-\n\nmunication systems and dams/storage systems.\n\nThe ﬁrst paper in this area has been published in 1981 by the author [3]. The\nasymptotic behavior of the mean busy period of the M/G/1 queueing system with\nservice depending on queue-length has been studied there. This and the several\nlater papers have been summarized in book [5]. Other research papers, associated\nwith application of (1.2) have appeared recently [7], [9] – [13].\nIn this survey\nwe also discuss many other closely related papers, the results of which have been\nobtained by many authors. Several new results related to the asymptotic behavior\nof consecutive losses in M/GI/1/n queueing systems are also established (Sect.\n3), and they then applied for analysis of consecutive losses in telecommunication\nsystems (Sect. 8).\n\nThe survey is organized as follows.\n\nIn Sect. 2-6, which are the ﬁrst part of\nthis survey, we discuss the classical loss queueing systems such as M/GI/1/n,\nGI/M/1/n and GI/M/m/n. For these systems we discuss applications of Tak´acs’\ntheorem 1.1 and Postnikov’s theorems 1.2 and 1.3 for analysis of the limiting sta-\ntionary loss probabilities. Sect. 3 contains new results on consecutive losses. In\nSect. 6 we discuss further research problems related to asymptotic analysis of large\nretrial queueing systems.\n\nIn Sect. 7-12, which, respectively, are the second part of this paper, we discuss\nvarious applications of these theorems for diﬀerent models of telecommunication\nsystems and dams/storage systems. All of these applications of Tak´acs’ theorem\nare not traditional, and, being speciﬁc, the models considered here describe real-\nworld systems or models for these systems. The results of Sect. 8 are new. They\nare based on applications of new results on consecutive losses, presented in Sect.\n3. In Sect. 11 we discuss further research problems and the ways of their solution\nassociated with asymptotic analysis and optimal control of large dams presented in\nSect. 9 and 10.\n\nPart 1. Applications to queueing systems 2. Losses in the M/GI/1/n queueing system \nConsidering M/GI/1/n queue, Tomk´o [88] was the ﬁrst person to establish re-\ncurrence relation (1.2) for the expected busy periods. (We assume that n is the\nnumber of waiting places excluding the service space.) Let Tn denote a busy period,\nand let Tk, k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, be busy periods associated with similar queueing\nsystems (i.e. having the same rate λ of Poisson input and the same probability\ndistribution function B(x) of a service time) but only having diﬀerent number of\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n5\n\nwaiting places. Namely Tomk´o [88] has derived\n\n(2.1)\n\nETn =\n\nE(Tn−j+1)\n\nn\n\n∞\n\ne−λx (λx)j\nj!\n\n0\n\ndB(x).\n\nZ\nIn the case of deterministic service times, Tomk´o [88] used Karamata’s Tauberian\ntheorem [89], Chapt. 5.\n\nj=0\nX\n\nRepresentation (2.1) has been also obtained by Cohen [32], Cooper and Tilt [33],\n\nRosenlund [67] as well as by the author in [3] and [5].\n\nThe relationship between the mean busy period in the M/GI/1/n queueing sys-\ntem and the maximum queue-length distribution in the M/GI/1 queueing system\nhas been established by Cooper and Tilt [33]. Namely, they derived Tak´acs’ result\n[78] on the supremum queue-length distribution of the M/G/1 queue during a busy\nperiod by the methods distinguished from the original Tak´acs’ method.\n\nWith the aid of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 one can easily study the asymptotic\nbehavior of ETn as n → ∞. Immediately from these theorems we correspondingly\nhave as follows.\n\nTheorem 2.1. If ρ < 1, then\n\nlim\nn→∞\n\nETn =\n\nρ\nλ(1 − ρ)\n\n.\n\nIf ρ = 1 and ρ2 = λ2\n\n∞\n\n0 x2dB(x) < ∞, then\nR\n\nlim\nn→∞\n\nETn\nn\n\n=\n\n2\nλρ2\n\n.\n\nIf ρ > 1, then\n\n(2.2)\n\nETn −\n\nρ\n\nλ[1 + λ\n\nB′(λ − λϕ)]ϕn )\n\n=\n\nρ\nλ(1 − ρ)\n\n,\n\nlim\nn→∞ (\n∞\n\nB(s) =\n\nwhere\nand ϕ is the least positive root of the equation\n\n0 e−sxdB(x) is the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of a service time,\n\nb\n\nb\n\n(2.3)\n\nR\n\nz =\n\nB(λ − λz).\n\nTheorem 2.2.

If ρ = 1 and ρ2 < ∞, then\n\nETn − ETn−1 =\n\n2\nλρ2\n\n+ o(1).\n\nThe proof of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 follows immediately from the statements of\n\nTheorems 1.1 and 1.2 correspondingly. Let us prove Theorem 2.3.\n\nProof. To prove this theorem, it is enough to show that for all λ > 0\n\n(2.4)\n\nB(λ) − λ\n\nB′(λ) < 1.\n\nThen all of the conditions of Theorem 1.3 will be satisﬁed, and the statement of\nb\nthis theorem will follow immediately from Theorem 1.3.\n\nb\n\n\n6\n\nVYACHESLAV M. ABRAMOV\n\nLet us prove (2.4). Taking into account that\ne−λx (λx)j\nj!\n\ndB(x) =\n\n∞\n\n∞\n\n∞\n\n∞\n\n0\nj=0 Z\nX\n\n0\nZ\n\nj=0\nX\n\ne−λx (λx)j\nj!\n\ndB(x) = 1,\n\nand\n\nwe have\n\n∞\n\ne−λx (λx)j\nj!\n\n0\nZ\n\ndB(x) ≥ 0\n\nB(λ) − λ\n\nB′(λ) ≤ 1.\n\nTherefore (2.4) will be proved if we show that for some λ0 the equality\n\n(2.5)\n\nb\n\nb\nB′(λ0) = 1\nB(λ0) − λ0\n\nb\n\nB(λ) − λ\n\nB(λ) − λ\nb\n\nB′(λ) is an analytic function in λ, then, ac-\nis not the case. Indeed, since\ncording to the theorem on maximum absolute value of an analytic function, equality\nB′(λ) = 1. This means that (2.5) is valid\nb\n(2.5) is to valid for all λ > 0, i.e.\n∞\nif and only if\nj! dB(x) = 0 for all j ≥ 2 and for all λ > 0. This in turn\nB(λ) = c0 + c1λ for some constants\nimplies that\nc0 and c1. However, because of |\nB(λ)| ≤ 1, we obtain c0 = 1 and c1 = 0. This\ncorresponds to the trivial case, where the probability distribution function B(x) is\nconcentrated in point 0. This case cannot be valid, since λ is assumed to be strictly\n(cid:3)\npositive. Therefore (2.5) is not the case, and hence (2.4) holds.\n\n0 e−λx (λx)j\nR\n\nB(λ) must be a linear function, i.e.\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nLet Ln denote the number of losses during the busy period Tn, and let νn denote\n\nthe number of served customers during the same busy period.\n\nUsing Wald’s equations [41], p.384, we have the following system.\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\nEνn + ELn = λETn + 1,\n\nEνn = µETn,\n\nwhere µ denotes the reciprocal of the expected service time. The term λETn of the\nright-hand side of (2.6) denotes the expected number of arrivals during a regen-\neration period excluding the ﬁrst (tagged) customer, who starts the busy period.\nEquations (2.6) and (2.7) are similar to those (1) and (2) of paper [8].\n\nFrom these two equations (2.6) and (2.7), by subtracting the second from the\n\nﬁrst, we obtain:\n\nleading to\n\n(2.8)\n\nELn = (λ − µ)ETn + 1,\n\nELn − 1 = (λ − µ)ETn.\n\nEquation (2.8) coincides with (7) of [7] which is written under another notation and\nwas derived by the diﬀerent method. From (2.8) we obtain the following recurrence\nrelation:\n\n(2.9)\n\nELn − 1 =\n\n(ELn−j+1 − 1)\n\nn\n\nj=0\nX\n\n∞\n\ne−λx (λx)j\nj!\n\n0\nZ\n\ndB(x), EL0 =\n\nλ\nµ\n\n= ρ.\n\nRecurrence relation (2.9) is the same as (3) of [7] and enables us to prove the\nfollowing theorem (see [4], [5] and [7]).\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n7\n\nTheorem 2.4.

In this case we equate πj with\n\n∞\n\ne−λx (λx)j\nj!\n\ndB(x),\n\n0\nZ\n\nand the condition π0 > 0 is equivalent to\nB(λ) > 0 and is satisﬁed. Then we equate\nγ1 with ρ and Qk with ELk − 1 and easily arrive at the statement of the theorem,\nwhere under the condition ρ > 1, there is a unique root of equation (2.3) belonging\nb\nto the interval (0,1) (e.g. Tak´acs [74]).\n\nThe most signiﬁcant consequence of this theorem is (2.10). This result met\nattention in the literature, and there is a number of papers that devoted to extension\nof this result. We mention [8], [63], [66], [64], [95] as well as [14]. On the other\nhand, rel. (2.10) is an unexpected generalization of the following elementary result\nfrom random walk theory1. (This random walk is associated with the Markovian\nM/M/1/n queueing system.) Namely, let X0, X1, . . . be random variables taking\nthe values ±1 with equal probability 1\n2 . Let S0 = 0. Then Sn = X1 + X2 + . . . + Xn\ncharacterizes a symmetric random walk starting at zero, and τ = inf{l > 0 : Sl = 0}\nis the moment of the ﬁrst return to zero point. Then for any level m 6= 0, the\nexpectation of the number of up-crossings across the level m during the random\ntime [0, τ ] is equal to 1\n2 .\n\nFor ρ > 1, the asymptotic analysis of ETn and ELn of the M/GI/1/n queue-\ning system has also been provided in Azlarov and Takhirov [18] and Azlarov and\nTashmanov [19] by methods of the complex analysis. The similar results for the\nGI/M/1/n queue have been obtained by Takhirov [86]. The asymptotic estima-\ntions obtained in these papers have the worse order of the remainder than that\nfollowing from Tak´acs’ theorem 1.1.\n\nTheorem 2.4 has been extended in [6] for the case of the M/GI/1 queueing\nsystem where if an arriving customer meets n or more customers in the queue, then\nhe joins the queue with probability p or lost with probability q = 1 − p.\n\nThe case ρ = 1 + δ where δn → C ≥ 0 as δ → 0 and n → ∞ falls into the area\nof the heavy traﬃc analysis. Under this assumption we have the following theorem\n(see, Theorem 2 of [7]).\n\n1The result is not widely known. The mention about this result can be found, for example, in\n\nthe book of Szekely [72]. For another relevant consideration see Wolﬀ [94], p. 411\n\n\n8\n\nVYACHESLAV M. ABRAMOV\n\nTheorem 2.5.

According\n\nto renewal theory, for the stationary loss probability Ploss we have:\n\nPloss =\n\nELn\n1 + EAn\n\n=\n\nELn\n1 + λETn\n\n.\n\nUnder the assumption ρ > 1, from Theorem 1.1 we have the following expansion\nfor EAn:\n\n(2.15)\n\nEAn =\n\nρϕ−n\nB′(λ − λϕ)\n\n1 + λ\n\n+\n\nρ\n1 − ρ\n\n+ o(1).\n\nTherefore under the assumption ρ > 1, for Ploss we obtain:\n\n(2.16)\n\nPloss =\n\nb\n(ρ − 1)2\nρ(ρ − 1) − ϕn[1 + λ\n\n[1 + o(ϕn)].\n\nB′(λ − λϕ)]\n\nUnder the assumption that ρ = 1 + δ, δ > 0, and δn → C ≥ 0 we have the\n\nfollowing result.\n\nb\n\nTheorem 2.6.

Consecutive losses in M/GI/1/n queues \nConsecutive losses are very important in performance analysis of real telecom-\nmunication systems. They have been studied in many papers, see [28], [29], [30],\n[35], [60], [61], [62] and many others. A convolution type recurrence relation for\nthe distribution of k consecutive losses during a busy period (or stationary prob-\nability of k consecutive losses) has been obtained in [61] for more general systems\nwith batch arrivals. Although the structure of these recurrence relations is simple,\nthe notation used there looks complicated. Unfortunately, an asymptotic analysis\nof these recurrence relations or those ones for other numerical characteristics, as\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n9\n\nn → ∞, has not been provided neither for the systems with batch arrivals that\nconsidered in this paper [61], nor for the simpler M/GI/1/n queueing systems.\n\nWe derive now the relation similar to (2.9) to the case of consecutive losses\nin M/GI/1/n queueing systems. By k-CCL probability2 we mean the (limiting)\nfraction of those losses belonging to sequences of k or more consecutive losses (we\ncall them k-consecutive losses) with respect to all of the losses that occur during a\nlong time interval. Let E1, E2, . . . , En be the states of the M/GI/1/n queueing\nsystem (n ≥ 1 and the notation for the M/GI/1/n queue excludes a customer\nin service) at the moments of service begins, i.e.\nstates when at the moments\nof service begins there are 1, 2, . . . , n customers in the system correspondingly.\nSuppose that the system is currently in the state Ej (1 ≤ j ≤ n). Then, a loss of\na customer (at least one) occurs in the case when during the service time of the\ntagged customer, which is currently in service, there are n − j + 2 or more new\narrivals. This probability is equal to\n\n∞\n\n∞\n\n0\ni=n−j+2 Z\nX\n\ne−λx (λx)i\ni!\n\ndB(x).\n\nOn the other hand, for the system that is being in state Ej, there is the probability\n\n∞\n\nXi=n−j+k+1 Z\n\n0\n\n∞\n\ne−λx (λx)i\ni!\n\ndB(x),\n\nthat the losses that occur during a service time, all are k-consecutive. (In this case\nthe number of arrivals during a service time is not smaller than n − j + k + 1.) Let\nqj = P(Ej) (q1 + q2 + . . . + qn = 1).

(According to the explicit representation (3.3) there exists the\nlimit of cn,k as n → ∞.)\n\nThe open question concerns the local property of ELn,k when the values n are\ndiﬀerent and ρ = 1. The question is: whether or not ELn,k is the same constant\nfor all n ≥ 0. The complicated explicit formula (3.3) does not permit us to answer\nto this question easily. In all likelihood, this property does not hold in the general\ncase. However, in the particular case of exponentially distributed service times,\nthe answer on this question is deﬁnite: ELn,k is the same for all n. To prove\nthis, notice ﬁrst that when ρ = 1, we have ETj − ETj−1 = 1\nλ for all j =\n1, 2, . . . , n.

Losses in the GI/M/m/n queue \nTak´acs’ theorem has also been applied for analysis of the loss probabilities in\nmultiserver GI/M/m/n queueing systems [11]. An application of Tak´acs’ theorem\nin this case, however, is not entirely straightforward and based on special approxi-\nmations. Speciﬁcally, the recurrence relation of convolution type (1.2) is valid only\nin limit, and a technically hard analytic proof with complicated notation is required\nin order to reduce the equations describing the stationary loss probability to the\nasymptotic recurrence relation of convolution type (1.2).\n\nIn this section we do not present the details of the proofs. These details of\nthe proofs can be found in [11]. We only formulate the theorems and discuss\ngeneral features and diﬀerences between the GI/M/m/n and GI/M/1/n cases in\nthe corresponding theorems.\n\nAs in the case m = 1 above, A(x) is the probability distribution function of\ninterarrival time, λ is the reciprocal of the expected interarrival time,\nA(s) is the\nLaplace-Stieltjes transform of A(x), where the argument s is assumed to be nonneg-\native. The parameter of the service time distribution is denoted by µ, and the load\nof the system ρ = λ/(mµ). The least positive root of the equation z =\nA(mµ−mµz)\nwill be denoted ϕm.

However, there is the diﬀerence\nbetween (5.4) and (4.7) associated with special representation (5.5) of the coeﬃcient\nKm, so the analysis of the case ρ < 1 is more delicate than that in the cases ρ > 1\nand ρ = 1.\n\nBy alternative methods, the asymptotic loss and stationary probabilities in\nGI/M/m/n queues have been studied in several papers. The analytic proofs given\nin these papers are much more diﬃcult than those by application of Tak´acs’ theo-\nrem 1.1. We refer Kim and Choi [48], Choi et al.

Future research problems \nIn the previous sections, applications of Tak´acs’ theorem to queueing systems\nhave been discussed. In this section, which concludes Part 1, we formulate prob-\nlems for the future applications of Tak´acs’ theorem to diﬀerent queueing systems.\nSpeciﬁcally, we discuss possible ways of application of Tak´acs theorem to retrial\nqueueing systems.\n\nConsider a single server queueing system with Poisson input rate λ and n number\nof waiting places. A customer, who upon arrival ﬁnds all waiting places busy, goes\nto the secondary system, and after some random time arrives at the main system\nagain. If at least one of waiting places is free, the customer joins the main queue.\nAssuming that service times in the main system are independent and identically\ndistributed random variables, one can interest in asymptotic behavior of the fraction\nof retrials with respect to the total number of arrivals during a busy period.\n\nAssumptions on retrials can be very diﬀerent. One of the simplest models is\nbased on the assumption that times between retrials are independent identically\ndistributed random variables, and their distribution is independent of the number\nof customer in the secondary system. In another model times between retrials are\nexponentially distributed with parameter depending on the number of customers\nin the secondary queue. The most familiar model amongst them is a model with\nlinear retrial policy: If the number of customers in the secondary system is j, then\nthe retrial rate is jµ.\n\nAsymptotic analysis as n → ∞ of the fraction of retrials with respect to the to-\ntal number of customers arrived during a busy period is a signiﬁcant performance\ncharacteristic of these large retrial queueing systems. An application of Tak´acs’\ntheorem should be based on comparison of the desired characteristics of retrial\nqueueing systems with the corresponding characteristics of the M/GI/1/n queue-\ning system with losses. Speciﬁcally, denoting by Ln the number of losses in the\nM/GI/1/n queueing system and by Rn the number of retrials in a given queueing\nsystem with retrials, we interest in ﬁnding the values cn supporting the equality\nERn = cnELn. If the properties of the sequence cn are well-speciﬁed (for example,\nthere exists a limit or an appropriate estimate), then the application of Tak´acs’\ntheorem to ERn as n → ∞ becomes elementary. (The asymptotic behavior of ELn\nis given by Theorem 2.4.)\n\nPart 2. Applications to stochastic models of communication systems\n\nand dam/storage systems 7. Asymptotic analysis of the number of lost messages in \ncommunication systems\n\nIn this section we study losses in optical telecommunication networks, where we\ndevelop the results on losses in M/GI/1/n queues considered in Section 1. We\ndiscuss the results established in [10].\n\nLong messages being sent are divided into a random number of packets which\nare transmitted independently of one another. An error in transmission of a packet\n\n\n16\n\nVYACHESLAV M. ABRAMOV\n\nresults in a loss of the entire message. Messages arrive to the M/GI/1 ﬁnite buﬀer\nmodel (the exact description of the model is given below) and can be lost in two\ncases as either at least one of its packets is corrupted or the buﬀer is overﬂowed.\n\nThe model is the following extension of the usual M/GI/1/n system. We con-\nsider queueing system with Poisson input rate λ of batch arrivals. The system serves\neach of these batches, and each service time has probability distribution B(x) with\nmean 1\nµ . The random batches κi are bounded from the above and below, so that\n\n(7.1)\n\nP{κlower ≤ κi ≤ κupper} = 1.\n\nκi is the number of packets associated with the ith message.\n\nLet us denote\n\nζ = sup\n\n(\n\nm\n\nm :\n\nκi ≤ N\n\n,\n\n)\n\ni=1\nX\n\nand according to assumption (7.1) there are two ﬁxed values ζlower and ζupper\ndepending on N and P{ζlower ≤ ζ ≤ ζupper} = 1. Let ξi be the number of messages\nin the queue immediately before arrival of the ith message. Then the message is\nlost if ξi > ζi. Otherwise it joins the queue. ζi is the ith (generic) random level\nin terms of a number of possible messages in the system. The special case when\nP{κi = l} = 1 (a message contains a ﬁxed (non-random) number of packets) leads\nto the standard M/GI/1/n queueing system, where n =\nis the integer part of\nN\nl .\n\nIt is also assumed that each message is marked with probability p, and we study\nthe asymptotic behavior of the loss probability under assumptions that Eζ increases\nto inﬁnity and p vanishes. The lost probability is the probability that the message\nis either marked or lost because of overﬂowing the queue. We demonstrate an\napplication of Tak´acs’ theorem as well as Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 for the solution of\nall of these problems.\n\nN\nl\n\n(cid:5)\n\n(cid:4)\n\nThe queueing system described above is not standard, and the explicit represen-\ntation for its characteristics can not be obtained traditionally. We will introduce a\nclass Σ of queueing systems. A simple representative of this class is the system S1\nwhich has been determined above for which we will establish the balance equation\nfor the expectations of accepted/rejected customers in the system which are similar\nto those of (2.6) and (2.7) in the case of the standard M/GI/1/n system. Such\nequations will be written explicitly in the sequel.\n\nIn order to deﬁne the class Σ let us ﬁrst study elementary processes of the system\n\nS1.\n\nLet ξi denote the number of messages in the system S1 immediately before arrival\nof the ith message, ξ1 = 0, and let si denote the number of service completions\nbetween the ith and i + 1st arrivals. Clearly, that\n\n(7.2)\n\nξi+1 = ξi − si + 1{ξi≤ζi},\nwhere the term 1{ξi≤ζi} in (7.2) indicates that the ith message is accepted.

New asymptotic results for the number of lost messages in \ntelecommunication systems\n\nIn this section we continue to study the asymptotic behavior of the number\nof lost messages in optical telecommunication systems. More speciﬁcally, in this\nsection we apply the results of Sect. 3 to establish the asymptotic results for\nconsecutive refused messages of the model described in the previous section. As in\nthe previous section the phrase refused message is used to indicate that the message\nis lost by overﬂowing the buﬀer, and in this section we provide new results just for\nconsecutive refused messages. For the number of k-consecutive refused messages\nwe use the notation Rζ(N ),k, i.e. we only add the index k to the previous notation\nRζ(N ) used in the previous section.\n\nAccording to Lemma 7.2\n\nERζ(N ) = (ρ − 1)EPζ(N ),\n\nand\n\nEPζ(N ) = µETζ(N )\n(see rel.

Optimal policies of using water in large dams: A simplified model \nb\n\nIn this section we discuss an application of Tak´acs’ theorem to optimal control\nof a large dam. We consider a simple variant of this problem given in [12]. The\nextended version corresponding to [13] will be discussed in the next section.\n\nThe upper and lower levels of a dam are denoted Lupper and Llower correspond-\ningly, and the diﬀerence between the upper and lower level n = Lupper − Llower\ncharacterizes the capacity of this dam. The value n is assumed to be large, and\nthis assumption enables us to use asymptotic analysis as n → ∞.\n\nWe assume that the units of water arriving at the dam are registered at random\ninstant t1, t2,. . . , and the interarrival times, τn = tn+1 − tn, are mutually inde-\npendent, exponentially distributed random variables with parameter λ. Outﬂow\nof water is state dependent as follows. If the level of water is between Llower and\nLupper then the dam is said to be in normal state and the duration time between\ndeparture of a unit of water has the probability distribution function B1(x). If the\nlevel of water increases the level Lupper, then the probability distribution function\nof the interval between unit departures is B2(x). If the level of water is exactly\nLlower, then the departure process of water is frozen, and it is resumed again as\nsoon as the level of water exceeds the value Llower.\n\nIn terms of queueing theory, the problem can be formulated as follows. Consider\na single-server queueing system with Poisson arrival stream of rate λ. The service\ntime of customers depends upon queue-length as follows. If at the moment of a\nbeginning of a service, the number of customers in the system is not greater than n,\nthen this customer is served by probability distribution function B1(x). Otherwise\n(if at the moment of a beginning of a service, the number of customers in the\nsystem exceeds n), then the probability distribution function of the service time of\nthis customer is B2(x). Notice, that the lower level Llower is associated with an\nempty dam. The dam speciﬁcation of the problem is characterized by performance\ncriteria, which in queueing formulation is as follows.\n\nLet Q(t) denote the (stationary) queue-length in time t. The problem is to\nchoose the output parameter of the system (parameter of service time distribution\nB1(x)) so to minimize the functional\n\n(9.1)\n\nJ(n) = p1(n)J1(n) + p2(n)J2(n),\n\nwhere p1(n) = limt→∞ P{Q(t) = 0}, p2(n) = limt→∞ P{Q(t) > n}, and J1(n),\nJ2(n) are the corresponding damage costs proportional to n. To be correct, assume\nthat J1(n) = j1n and J2(n) = j2n, where j1 and j2 are given positive values.\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n23\n\nAssuming that n → ∞ we will often write the p1 and p2 without index n. The\nindex n will be also omitted in other functions such as J1, J2 and so on.\n\nWe will assume that the input rate λ and probability distribution function B2(x)\nare given. The unknown parameter in the control problem is associated with prob-\nability distribution function B1(x). We will assume that B1(x) = B1(x, C) is the\nfamily of probability distributions depending on parameter C ≥ 0, and this param-\n∞\neter C is closely related to the expectation\n0 xdB1(x). Then the output rate of\nthe system in the normal state is associated with the choice of parameter C ≥ 0\nresulting the choice of B1(x, C).\n\n=\n\nWe use the notation 1\nµi\n\nfor i = 1, 2. We assume\nthat ρ2 < 1, and this last assumption provides the stationary behavior of queueing\nsystem and existence of required limiting stationary probabilities p1 and p2 (inde-\npendent of an initial state of the process). In addition, we assume existence of the\nthird moment, ρ1,k =\n\n∞\n\n∞\n\nR\n0 xdBi(x), and ρi = λ\nµi\nR\n\nFor the above state dependent queueing system introduce the notation as follows.\nLet Tn, In, and νn respectively denote the duration of a busy period, the duration\nof an idle period, and the number of customers served during a busy period. Let\nT (1)\nrespectively denote the total times during a busy period when 0 <\nn\nQ(t) ≤ n and Q(t) > n, and let ν(1)\nn and ν(2)\nn respectively denote the total numbers\nof customers served during a busy period when 0 < Q(t) ≤ n and Q(t) > n.\n\nand T (2)\n\nn\n\n0 (λx)kdB1(x) < ∞, k = 2, 3.\nR\n\nWe have the following two equations\n\n(9.2)\n\n(9.3)\n\nETn = ET (1)\nEνn = Eν(1)\n\nn + ET (2)\nn ,\nn + Eν(2)\nn .\n\nFrom Wald’s equation [41], p.384, we obtain:\n\n(9.4)\n\n(9.5)\n\nET (1)\nn\n\nET (2)\nn\n\n=\n\n=\n\n1\nµ1\n1\nµ2\n\nEν(1)\nn ,\n\nEν(2)\nn .\n\nThe number of arrivals during a busy cycle coincides with the total number of\n\nserved customers during a busy period.

This property\nis established in [5] together the aforementioned property of losses in M/GI/1/n\nqueues (see relation (2.10)).\n\nSimilarly, from (9.5) and (9.8) we obtain:\n\n(9.10)\n\nET (2)\n\nn =\n\n1\nµ(1 − ρ2)\n\n−\n\n1 − ρ1\nµ(1 − ρ2)\n\nET (1)\nn .\n\nFrom equations (9.8) and (9.10) one can obtain the stationary probabilities p1\nand p2.

Our next arguments\nare based on sample path arguments and the property of the lack of memory of\nexponential distribution. Using all of this, one concludes that the random variable\nν(1)\ncoincides in distribution with the number of customers served during a busy\nn\nperiod of the M/GI/1/n queueing system.

Under\nthe assumption that ρ1 < 1, relations (9.14) and (9.15) enables us to conclude as\nfollows. The probability p1 in positive in limit, while the probability p2 vanishes.\nTherefore, in the case ρ1 < 1 we have J ≈ (1 − ρ1)J1, so J increases to inﬁnity\nbeing asymptotically equivalent to (1 − ρ1)j1n. The similar conclusion follows from\nIn this case the probability p1\n(9.16) and (9.17) under the assumption ρ1 > 1.\nvanishes, while the probability p2 tends to the positive limit ρ2(ρ1−1)\n(ρ1−ρ2) . This enables\nus to conclude that J increases to inﬁnity together with n increasing to inﬁnity\nbeing asymptotically equivalent to ρ2(ρ1−1)\n(ρ1−ρ2) j2n. In the case ρ1 = 1 both p1 and\n1\np2 vanish at rate O\n, and J therefore converges to the limit as n → ∞. Thus,\nn\nρ1 = 1 is a possible solution to the control problem, while the cases ρ1 < 1 and\nρ1 > 1 are irrelevant.

Under the conditions of Theorem 9.4, assume that C = 0. Then\nwe obtain (9.23) and (9.24).\n\nTheorems 9.4 and 9.5 do not follow directly from other theorems as this was in\nthe case of Theorem 9.2, which is derived from 9.1 by using appropriate asymptotic\nexpansions. The proof of Theorem 9.4 is based on Tauberian theorem of Hardy and\nLittlewood which can be found in many sources (e.g.\n[65], [71], [73], [75], p. 203\nand [89]).

Expanding the denominator of (9.27) to the Taylor series, we obtain:\nb\n\n1 − z\n\n1 − z\n\nB(λ − λz) − z\n\nb\n\n(9.28)\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n1 − z − ρ1(1 − z) + (\n\nρ1,2/2)(1 − z)2 + O((1 − z)3)\n\n1\n\nδ + (\n\nρ1,2/2)(1 − z) + O((1 − z)2)\n1\n\ne\n\nδ[1 + (\ne\n\nρ1,2/2δ)(1 − z) + O((1 − z)2)]\n\n1\n\nδ exp((\n\nρ1,2/2δ)(1 − z))\ne\n\n(1 + o(1)).\n\nTherefore, assuming that z = (n − 1)/n → 1 as n → ∞, from (9.28) we have:\n\n(9.29)\n\nEν(1)\n\nn =\n\ne\n\n1\n\nδee\n\nρ1,2/2C (1 + o(1)).\n\nSubstituting (9.29) into (9.11) and (9.12) we arrive at the desired statement of\nTheorem 9.4. The proof of Theorem 9.5 is similarly based on the above expansion.\nAbove Theorems 9.2 - 9.5 enable us to solve the control problem.

To indicate only a few of\nthem we refer [1], [2], [20], [40], [51], [52] and [96]. However, the optimal control\nproblem of dams and its solution, which is discussed in this section of the paper,\nspeciﬁcally diﬀers from all of the earlier considerations known from the literature.\nIn the next section we discuss a more extended control problem of large dams. 10.

The costs ci are assumed\nto be decreasing in i, i.e. ci+1 ≤ ci for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. (The water is cheaper\nwhen the dam level is higher.)\n\nIn queueing formulation the level Llower is equated with an empty queue. The\nqueueing formulation of the dam model is given in the previous section. All of the\nassumptions for that state-dependent queueing system remains the same.\n\nIt was shown in the previous section that the probabilities p1 and p2 are expressed\nvia Eν(1)\nn (relations (9.11) and (9.12)), and the asymptotic representations of p1 and\np2 is derived from the asymptotic formula of Eν(1)\nn . The stationary probabilities\nqi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n can be obtained from renewal arguments (see e.g. Ross [68]).\nNamely, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n we have:\n\n(10.3)\n\nqi =\n\nET (1)\n\ni − ET (1)\nETn + EIn\n\ni−1\n\n.\n\n(ET (1)\ni means the expectation of the total time that the customers are served by\nprobability distribution function B1(x) during a busy period of the state-dependent\nsystem, which is distinguished from the described system only by parameter i given\ninstead of the original parameter n. According to sample-path arguments and the\nproperty of the lack of memory of exponential distribution (these arguments are\ngiven in the previous section), the random variable T (1)\ncoincides in distribution\nwith a busy period of the M/GI/1/i queueing system.)

Speciﬁcally, [13] ﬁnds numerically the\nrelation between j1 and j2, under which the optimal solution to the control problem\nis ρ1 = 1. 11. Optimal policies of using water in large dams: Future research \nproblems\n\nIn Sect. 9 and 10, optimal policies of using water in large dams are studied.\nBoth these models are the same queueing systems with speciﬁed dependence of a\nservice on queue-length, and in both of them the input stream is Poisson. The\nonly diﬀerence is in the criteria of minimization. The minimization criteria in the\nsimple model is based on penalties for passage across the lower and higher level.\nThe minimization criteria of the extended model takes also into account the water\ncosts depending on the level of water in the dam.\n\nHowever, the assumption that input stream is Poisson is restrictive. So, the\nfollowing extension of these models towards their clearer application in practice lies\nin an assumption of a wider class of input process than ordinary Poisson. In this\nsection we discuss a possible way of analysis in the case when the input stream is\na compound Poisson process.\n\nLet t1, t2, . . . be the moment of arrivals of units at the system, and let κ1, κ2, . . .\nbe independent and identically distributed integer random variables characterizing\nthe corresponding lengths of these units. As in Sect. 7 it is reasonable to assume\nthat\n\nP{κlower ≤ κi ≤ κupper} = 1\n\n(see rel. (7.1)).\n\nLet us recall the meaning of parameter n in the dam models of Sect. 9 and 10.\nThat parameter n is deﬁned in the following formulation of queueing system. Con-\nsider a single-server queueing system where the arrival ﬂow of customers is Poisson\nwith rate λ and the service time of a customer depends upon queue-length as fol-\nlows. If, at the moment the customer’s service beginning, the number of customers\nin the system is not greater than n, then the service time of this customer has\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n35\n\nthe probability distribution B1(x). Otherwise (if there are more than n customers\nin the system at the moment of the customer’s service beginning), the probability\ndistribution function of the service time of this customer is B2(x).\n\nIn our case customers arrive by batches κ1, κ2, . . ., so as in Sect. 7 it is reasonable\n\nto deﬁne the random parameter ζ = ζ(n):\n\nζ = sup\n\n(\n\nm\n\nm :\n\nκi ≤ n\n\n,\n\n)\n\ni=1\nX\n\nThere are two ﬁxed values ζlower and ζupper depending on n and\n\nP{ζlower ≤ κi ≤ ζupper} = 1.\nThus, the following construction, similar to the construction that used in Sect. 7,\nholds in this case as well. Speciﬁcally, Deﬁnition 7.1 and the following application of\nthe formulae for the total expectation for characteristic of the system with random\nparameter ζ are the same as above in Sect. 7. Then the deﬁnition of random\nvariables T (1)\n, ν(1)\nζ with random parameter ζ is similar to the deﬁnition\nζ\nof the corresponding random variables T (1)\nn , ν(2)\nn given in Sect. 9 and 10.\nζ(n) with ET (2)\nζ(n) and ET (1)\nThere are also equalities allying Eν(1)\nζ(n) as\n\nn , ν(1)\nn , T (2)\nζ(n) with Eν(2)\n\n, T (2)\nζ\n\n, ν(2)\n\nζ\n\nEν(2)\n\nζ(n) = a1,nEν(1)\n\nζ(n) + a2,n\n\nand\n\nET (2)\n\nζ(n) = b1,nET (1)\n\nζ(n) + b2,n.\n\nThe sequences a1,n, a2,n, b1,n and b2,n converge to the corresponding limits a1, a2,\nb1 and b2. But the values of constants a1, a2, b1 and b2 are not the same as those\ngiven by (9.8) and (9.10). Special analysis based on renewal theory to ﬁnd these\nconstants is required.\n\nAnother diﬀerence between the analysis of the problem described in Sect. 10 and\nthat analysis of the present problem is connected with the structures of water costs.\nIn the case of the problem described in Sect. 10 the water costs are non-increasing.\nIn the present formulation, where the length of arrival units are random, the water\ncosts, being initially non-increasing with respect to levels of water, after reduction\nto the model with random parameter ζ become random variables. However, the\nexpected values of these random costs satisfy the same property, they are non-\nincreasing.\n\nSo, the statement on existence and uniqueness of an optimal strategy of water\nconsumption is anticipated to be the same as in the earlier consideration in Sect.\n10 where, however, the optimal solution itself and its structure can be diﬀerent. 12. The buffer model with priorities \nIn this section we give the application of Tak´acs’ theorem for a speciﬁc buﬀer\nmodel with priorities. This section contains one of the results of [15] related to the\neﬀective bandwidth problem [15], and the model studied here is a particular case of\nmore general models of [15]. The eﬀective bandwidth problem was a “hot topic” of\napplications of queueing theory during the decade 1990-2000. The detailed review\nof the existence literature up to the publication time can be found in the paper of\nBerger and Whitt [21]. For other papers published later than aforementioned one\nsee [22], [24], [34], [38], [39], [50], [53], [92], [93] and other papers.\n\n\n36\n\nVYACHESLAV M. ABRAMOV\n\nLet A(t) be a renewal process of ordinary arrivals to telecommunication system\nhaving a large buﬀer of capacity N . Each of these arrivals belongs to the priority\nℓ\nclass k with positive probability p(k),\nk=1 p(k) = 1, where a smaller index corre-\nsponds to a higher priority. By thinning the renewal process A(t) we thus have ℓ\nindependent renewal processes A(1)(t), A(2)(t),. . . , A(ℓ)(t), where the highest pri-\nority units are associated with the process A(1)(t), and arrivals corresponding to\nA(i)(t) have higher priority than arrivals corresponding to A(j)(t) for i < j.\n\nP\n\nThe departure process, D(t), is assumed to be a Poisson process with constant\ninteger jumps C ≥ 1. The process D(t) is common for all of units independently of\ntheir priorities.\n\nLet Q(k)(t) denote the buﬀer content in time t for units of priority k. All of the\nprocesses considered here are assumed to be right continuous, having left limits,\nand all of them are assumed to start at zero. Exceptions from these rules will be\nmentioned especially.\n\nLet us now describe the priority rule. To simplify the explanation, let us ﬁrst\n\nassume that the buﬀer is inﬁnite. Then, for the highest priority units we have:\n\n(12.1)\n\nQ(1)(t) = max{0, Q(1)(t−) + △A(1)(t) − △D(t)},\n\nwhere the triangle in (12.1) denotes the value of jump of the process in point t, i.e.\n△A(1)(t) = A(1)(t) − A(1)(t−), △D(t) = D(t) − D(t−).\n\nFor the second priority units, we have:\n\n(12.2)\n\nQ(2)(t) = max\n\n0, Q(2)(t−) + △A(2)(t) − [△D(t) − Q(1)(t−)]1{Q(1)(t)=0}\n\n.\n\nIn general, for the k + 1st priority units (k = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ − 1) we have\n\nn\n\no\n\n(12.3)\n\nQ(k+1)(t) = max\n\n0, Q(k+1)(t−) + △A(k+1)(t)\n\nn\n△D(t) −\n\nk\n\n−\n\n\"\n\ni=1\nX\n\nQ(i)(t−)\n#\n\n1{Pk\n\ni=1 Q(i)(t)=0}\n\n.\n\n)\n\nEquations (12.2) and (12.3) implies that the priority rule is the following. The\nunits are ordered and then leave the system according to their priority as follows.\nLet, for example, there be 6 units in total, two of them are of highest priority and\nthe rest four are of second priority. Let C = 3. Then, after the departure of a\ngroup of three units, there will remain only 3 units of the second priority. That is\nall of the units (i.e. two) of the highest priority and one unit of the second priority\nleave simultaneously.\n\nFor k = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ, using the notation\n\nand\n\nQk(t) = Q(1)(t) + Q(2) + . . . + Q(k),\n\nenables us to write the relations\n\nAk(t) = A(1)(t) + A(2) + . . . + A(k)\n\n(12.4)\n\nQk(t) = max{0, Qk(t−) + △Ak(t) − △D(t)},\n\nwhich are similar to (12.1). The equivalence of (12.4) and (12.1) - (12.3) is proved\nby induction in [15].\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n37\n\nAccording to (12.4), the stability condition for this priority queueing system\nwith inﬁnite queues is ρℓ < 1, where ρℓ = λ\nµC , λ is the expected number of ar-\nrivals per time unit, µ the parameter of departure Poisson process, and C is the\naforementioned constant jump of this Poisson process. We will assume that this\ncondition holds for ﬁnite buﬀer models too (for ﬁnite buﬀer models the above sta-\nbility condition is not required). So, if all the buﬀers are large, then the losses occur\nseldom.\n\nIn the case of ﬁnite buﬀer models, the representations are similar. Denote the\ncapacity for the total number of units of priority k (the number of units of priority\nk that can be present simultaneously in the system) by N (k), and N (1) + N (2) +\n. . . + N (ℓ) = N . We will assume here that if upon an arrival of a batch, the buﬀer\nof the given class is overﬂowed, then the entire arrival batch is rejected and lost\nfrom the system.\n\nIntroduce new arrival processes A\n\n(k)\n\n(t), k = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ, corresponding to the kth\n\npriority as follows. Let the jump △A\n\n(k)\n\n(t) is deﬁned as\n\n(12.5)\n\n(k)\n\n△A\n\n(t) = △A(k)(t)1{Q(k)(t)≤N (k)}.\n\nThe diﬀerence between the process A(k)(t) and A\n(t) is only in jumps. In the\ncase of the originally deﬁned process A(k)(t) the jumps are △A(k)(t), while in the\n(k)\ncase of the process A\n(t). In addition, it turns out that the\n(k)\n\n(t) they are △A\n\n(t) is not right continuous. There are isolated points at moments of\n\nprocess A\noverﬂowing the buﬀer of the given priority units.\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nThen the buﬀer content for units of the highest priority is deﬁned by equations:\n\n(12.6)\n\n(12.7)\n\nQ(1)(t) = max{Q(1)(t−) + △A(1)(t) − △D(t)},\n\nQ(1)(t+) = max{Q(1)(t−) + △A\n\n(1)\n\n(t) − △D(t)}.\n\nIn all continuity points of the processes Q(k)(t), k = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ, one can obtain\ngeneral representation similar to that of (12.4). Denoting\n\nAk(t) = A\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(t) + A\n\n(t) + . . . + A\n\n(k)\n\n(t),\n\none can show the following representations:\n\n(12.8)\n\n(12.9)\n\nQk(t) = max{Qk(t−) + △Ak(t) − △D(t)},\nQk(t+) = max{Qk(t−) + △Ak(t) − △D(t)},\n\nwhich are supposed to be correct for continuity points of the processes Qk(t) only.\nAccording to representations (12.8) and (12.9), the cumulative buﬀer contents\nQk(t), k = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ, in continuity points behave as usual queue-length processes\nin GI/M C/1/Nk queueing systems, where Nk = N (1) + N (2) + . . . + N (k) (Nℓ =\nN ). However, the behavior of the number of losses is essentially diﬀerent. The\nlosses in GI/M C /1/Nk queues are not adequate to the losses in the corresponding\ncumulative buﬀers Qk(t). Speciﬁcally, the losses in GI/M C/1/Nk queues occur only\nin the case when the buﬀer is overﬂowed upon arrival of a customer meeting all of\nthe waiting places busy. The losses in the cumulative buﬀers Qk(t) can occur in\nmany cases, when one of the buﬀers of priority units (say the jth buﬀer, 1 ≤ j ≤ k)\nis overﬂowed.\n\n\n38\n\nVYACHESLAV M. ABRAMOV\n\nHowever, in some cases when the values N1 < N2 < . . . < Nℓ all are large, the\ncorrespondence between GI/M C /1/Nk queues and ﬁnite buﬀers models, giving us\nuseful asymptotic result, is possible. Speciﬁcally, the loss probability of a customer\narriving to one of the ﬁrst k buﬀers is not greater than π1 + π2 + . . . + πk, where πi\ndenotes the loss probability in the corresponding GI/M C/1/Ni queueing system.\nLet Ai(x) (i = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ) denote the probability distribution function of inter-\narrival time between arrivals of one of the ﬁrst i priority customers,\nAi(s) is the\nLaplace-Stieltjes transform of Ai(x). All of the probabilities πk are small and de-\ncrease geometrically fast (see Theorem 12.1 below). Since the loads ρ1, ρ2,. . . ,ρℓ\nof corresponding cumulative processes increase, i.e. ρ1 < ρ2 < . . . < ρℓ, then the\nroots ϕk of the corresponding functional equations appearing in the aforementioned\ntheorem are ordered ϕ1 < ϕ2 < . . . < ϕk. Such type of dependence between the\nroots ϕk and the loads ρk, k = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ is because of the special construction of\ninterarrival times. Then, under the assumption that ϕNj\nk ), j < k, (i.e. the\nlosses of lower priority customers occur much often compared to those of higher pri-\nority) the loss probability of the cumulated buﬀer of the ﬁrst k priority customers\ncan be approximated by πk. In this case we have the following theorem.\n\nj = o(ϕNk\n\nb\n\nTheorem 12.1. For the loss probability πk of cumulated buﬀer content we have\nthe following estimation:\n\n(12.10)\n\nπk =\n\n+o\n\n,\n\nϕ2Nk\nk\n(cid:16)\n\n(cid:17)\n\nwhere\n\n(1 − ρk)(1 + ϕk + ϕ2\n\n(1 − ρk)[1 + Cµ\n\nA′\n2 + . . . + ϕC−1\nb\n\nk\n\nk )]ϕNk\nk(µ − µϕC\nk\nA′\n) − ρk[1 + Cµ\n\nk(µ − µϕC\n\nk )]ϕNk\n\nk\n\nb\n\nρk =\n\n,\n\nλk\nµC\nk\n\nλk = λ\n\np(i),\n\nand ϕk is the least positive root of the functional equation\n\ni=1\nX\n\nz =\n\nAk(µ − µzC)\n\nb\n\nin the interval (0,1).\nProof. We consider the GI/M C/1/Nk queueing system and, similarly to the proof\nof Sect. 4, this proof is based on an application of Tak´acs’ theorem. Following\nMiyazawa [59], the loss probability for the GI/M Y /1/Nk queueing system (in this\nnotation the batch size Y is an integer random variable rather than a determinis-\ntic constant that in the cases of the notation GI/M C /1/Nk considered before) is\ndetermined by the formula\n\n(12.11)\n\nπk =\n\n1\nNk\nj=0 rk,j\n\n,\n\nwhich is similar to relation (4.1). The generating function of rk,j is\n\nP\n\n(12.12)\n\nRk(z) =\n\nrk,j zj =\n\n∞\n\nj=0\nX\n\n(1 − Y (z))\n\nAk[µ − µY (z)]\n\nAk[µ − µY (z)] − z\nb\n\n,\n\nb\n\n\nTAK ´ACS’ ASYMPTOTIC THEOREM AND ITS APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n39\n\nwhere Y (z) is the generating function of a complete batch size.\nGI/M C/1/Nk queueing system Y (z) = zC, and (12.12) is rewritten\n\nIn the case of\n\n(12.13)\n\nRk(z) =\n\n(1 − zC)\n\nAk(µ − µzC)\n\n.\n\nAk(µ − µzC) − z\nb\n\nExpanding (1−zC) in the numerator of (12.13) as 1−zC = (1−z)(1+z+. . .+zC−1),\nwe have:\n\nb\n\n(12.14)\n\nRk(z) =\n\n(1 − z)(1 + z + z2 + . . . + zC−1)\nAk(µ − µzC ) − z\n\nAk(µ − µzC)\n\n.\n\nb\n\nRk(z) = 1\n\n1−z R(z).\n\nNow, let us consider the other generating function given by\nFrom (12.14) we obtain:\n\nb\n\n∞\n\n(12.15)\n\nRk(z) =\n\nrk,j zj =\n\nj=0\nX\nand the loss probability is\n\ne\n\ne\n\n(12.16)\n\n(1 + z + z2 + . . . + zC−1)\n\nAk(µ − µzC)\n\ne\n\nAk(µ − µzC) − z\nb\n\nb\n\n1\nrk,Nk\n\n.\n\nπk =\n\n,\n\nNow, application of Tak´acs’ theorem is straightforward, because the term\n\ne\nAk(µ − µzC)\nAk(µ − µzC ) − z\n\nb\n\nof (12.15) has the representation similar to (1.3), and therefore the corresponding\ncoeﬃcients of the generating function satisfy recurrence relation (1.2).\n\nb\n\nFor large Nk we obtain:\n\n(12.17)\n\nrk,Nk =\n\n1 + ϕk + . . . + ϕC−1\nϕNk\nk\n\nk\n\n·\n\n1\n\n1 + µC\n\nA(µ − µϕC\nk )\n\ne\n\n+\n\n(1 + ϕk + . . . + ϕC−1\n\nk\n\n)ρk\n\nρk − 1\n\n+ o(1).\nb\n\nAsymptotic relation (12.10) follows from (12.16) and (12.17).\n\n(cid:3)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe part of this paper has been written while the author was visiting the De-\npartment of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research in the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley.

Arrival and departure processes are governed by marked point processes. There are ℓ buffers corresponding to priority classes, and upon arrival a unit of the kth priority class occupies a place in the kth buffer. Let N (k), k = 1,2,…, ℓ denote the quota for the total kth buffer content. The values N (k) are assumed to be large, and queueing systems both with finite and infinite buffers are studied. In the case of a system with finite buffers, the values N (k) characterize buffer capacities. This article discusses a circle of problems related to optimization of performance measures associated with overflowing the quota of buffer contents, particularly buffers models. Our approach to this problem is new, and the presentation of our results is simple and clear for real applications.

We consider several sessions that generate traffic into a finite capacity queue. Using multi-dimensional probability generating functions, we derive analytical formulas for the loss probabilities and provide asymptotic analysis (for large n and small or large ρ). Our analysis allows us to investigate when does adding redundancy decrease the loss probabilities. In many cases, redundancy is shown to degrade the performance, as the gain in adding redundancy is not sufficient to compensate the additional losses due to the increased overhead. We show, however, that it is possible to decrease loss probabilities if a sufficiently large amount of redundancy is added. Indeed, we show that for an arbitrary stationary ergodic input process, if ρ<1 then redundancy can reduce loss probabilities to an arbitrarily small value."

The associated admissible set with a single linear boundary makes it possible to apply stochastic-loss-network (generalized-Erlang) models for capacity planning. We consider the case of network nodes that use a priority-service discipline to support multiple classes of service, and we wish to determine an appropriate notion of effective bandwidths. Just as was done previously for the first-in first-out (FIFO) discipline, we use large-buffer asymptotics (large deviations principles) for workload tail probabilities as a theoretical basis. We let each priority class have its own buffer and its own constraint on the probability of buffer overflow. Unfortunately, however, this leads to a constraint for each priority class. Moreover, the large-buffer asymptotic theory with priority classes does not produce an admissible set with linear boundaries, but we show that it nearly does and that a natural bound on the admissible set does have this property. We propose it as an approximation for priority classes; then there is one linear constraint for each priority class. This linear-admissible-set structure implies a new notion of effective bandwidths, where a given connection is associated with multiple effective bandwidths: one for the priority level of the given connection and one for each lower priority level. This structure can be used regardless of whether the individual effective bandwidths are determined by large-buffer asymptotics or by some other method."

Accordingly, allocation of network resources based on different priority levels is becoming a realistic possibility. Thus, we need new methods for connection admission control and capacity planning that take account of the priority structure. We show that the notion of effective bandwidths can be used for these purposes when appropriately extended. The key is to have admissibility of a set of connections determined by a linear constraint for each priority level, involving a performance criterion for each priority level. For this purpose, connections are assigned more than one effective bandwidth, one for its own priority level and one for each lower priority level. Candidate effective bandwidths for each priority level can be determined by using previous methods associated with the first-in first-out discipline. The proposed effective bandwidth structure makes it possible to apply product-form stochastic loss network models to perform dimensioning."

Under specific scheduling policies for sharing bandwidth among these classes, we seek the asymptotic (as the buffer size goes to infinity) tail of the buffer overflow probability for each dedicated buffer. We assume dependent arrival and service processes as is usually the case in models of bursty traffic. In the standard large deviations methodology, we provide a lower and a matching (up to first degree in the exponent) upper bound on the buffer overflow probabilities. We introduce a novel optimal control approach to address these problems. In particular, we relate the lower bound derivation to a deterministic optimal control problem, which we explicitly solve. Optimal state trajectories of the control problem correspond to typical congestion scenarios. We explicitly and in detail characterize the most likely modes of overflow. We specialize our results to the generalized processor sharing policy (GPS) and the generalized longest queue first policy (GLQF). The performance of strict priority policies is obtained as a corollary. We compare the GPS and GLQF policies and conclude that GLQF achieves smaller overflow probabilities than GPS for all arrival and service processes for which our analysis holds. Our results have important implications for traffic management of high-speed networks and can be used as a basis for an admission control mechanism which guarantees a different loss probability for each class."

The currently accepted approach for the design of GPS schedulers is based on deterministic QoS guarantees, which, it is generally accepted, is overly conservative and leads to limitations on capacity. We develop a framework for GPS scheduling which is based on statistical QoS guarantees and statistical multiplexing. We give the design of GPS weights which maximize the coverage of operating points, and also the design of the connection admission control (CAC). The general framework is end-to-end, with two heterogeneous QoS classes coexisting with a third, best effort class. Each QoS class has a specified delay bound together with a bound on the probability of its violation. An important objective is to maximize the bandwidth available to best effort traffic, while just satisfying the guarantees of the QoS classes. To this end, we consider output regulated GPS scheduling, which limits each connection's share of the bandwidth to a designed value. The sources are subject to standard dual leaky bucket regulation. For the design of the GPS weights we give procedures based on two key concepts, the realizable set and the critical weights. The realizable set is the union of all admissible sets of connections of both classes over all weights. One of the main contributions is a pragmatic design process by which most of the realizable set is realized by only two critical weights. The numerical results show that there are substantial capacity gains from statistical multiplexing."

The result is an admissible region bounded by a finite number of hyperplanes and a simple and efficient call admission policy. The CDMA mobile network, operating within the admissible region described, has a very similar form to a circuit-switched network operating with fixed routing. This similarity allows the existing traffic modeling techniques and network management strategies for general loss networks to be applied to CDMA mobile cellular networks.
