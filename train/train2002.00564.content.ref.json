In\nparticular, most of F comes from the fundamental group of a surface fiber. A\nkey feature of M is that there is an element of its fundamental group with an\neigenvalue which is the square root of a rational integer.

Their construction may be applied to arbitrary curves in the\nSL_2(C)-character variety of a connected, compact, orientable, irreducible\n3-manifold whose boundary is a torus, though in this generality one can only\nguarantee that it will define a seminorm.\n  The first half of this paper is devoted to the development of the general\ntheory of Culler-Shalen seminorms defined for curves of PSL_2(C)-characters. By\nworking over PSL_2(C) we obtain a theory that is more generally applicable than\nits SL_2(C) counterpart, while being only mildly more difficult to set up.\n  In the second half of this paper we apply the theory of Culler-Shalen\nseminorms to study the Dehn filling operation.

The first polynomial invariant of links devised to help answer this\nquestion was the Alexander polynomial (1928). Almost a century after its\nintroduction, it still presents us with tantalizing questions such as Fox's\nconjecture (1962) that the absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander\npolynomial $\\Delta_L(t)$ of an alternating link $L$ are unimodal. Fox's\nconjecture remains open in general, with special cases settled by Hartley\n(1979) for two-bridged knots, by Murasugi (1985) for a family of alternating\nalgebraic links, and by Ozsv\\'ath and Szab\\'o (2003) for the case of genus $2$\nalternating knots, among others.\n  We settle Fox's conjecture for special alternating links. We do so by proving\nthat a certain multivariate generalization of the Alexander polynomial of\nspecial alternating links is Lorentzian. As a consequence, we obtain that the\nabsolute values of the coefficients of $\\Delta_L(t)$, where $L$ is a special\nalternating link, form a log-concave sequence with no internal zeros. In\nparticular, they are unimodal."

Their construction may be applied to arbitrary curves in the\nSL_2(C)-character variety of a connected, compact, orientable, irreducible\n3-manifold whose boundary is a torus, though in this generality one can only\nguarantee that it will define a seminorm.\n  The first half of this paper is devoted to the development of the general\ntheory of Culler-Shalen seminorms defined for curves of PSL_2(C)-characters.

There is no bound on the number of components\nof the link (or boundary components). For statements, see the second part of\nthe introduction. Here are two examples of the results we obtain:\n  1) Let K be a component of a link L in S^3. Then \"most\" slopes on K cannot be\ncompleted to a cosmetic surgery on L, unless K becomes a component of a Hopf\nlink.\n  2) Let X be a manifold and \\epsilon&gt;0. Then all but finitely many hyperbolic\nmanifolds obtained by filling X admit a geodesic shorter than \\epsilon\\ (note\nthat this finite set may correspond to an infinitely many fillings)."

Toward the end of XIX century and at\nthe beginning of XX century several young mathematicians, educated in Germany,\nFrance or England were returning to their native countries and building, almost\nfrom scratch, schools of modern mathematics. After a general description of the\ngrowth of topology in Japan between the World Wars, we describe the beginning\nof Knot Theory in Japan. Gaisi Takeuti, later a famous logician, conducted the\nfirst Knot Theory seminar in Japan in 1952 or 1953. Kunio Murasugi (later a\nprominent knot theoretist) was the only student who attended it. In Osaka, a\nKnot Theory seminar started in 1955, initiated by Hidetaka Terasaka and his\nstudents Shin'ichi Kinoshita and Takeshi Yajima. We complete the paper by\nlisting 70 Japanese topologists born before 1946, and by sketching the\nbiography of Fox."

For example, in the bus and metro network of New Delhi, only 30% of\nstops can be directly accessed from any starting point, thus requiring\ntransfers for most commutes. Additionally, last-mile services like rickshaws,\ntuk-tuks or shuttles are commonly used as feeders to the nearest public transit\naccess points, which further adds to the complexity and inefficiency of a\njourney. Ultimately, users often face a tradeoff between coverage and transfers\nto reach their destination, regardless of the mode of transit or the use of\nlast-mile services. To address the problem of limited accessibility and\ninefficiency due to transfers in public transit systems, we propose\n``opti-mile,\" a novel trip planning approach that combines last-mile services\nwith public transit such that no transfers are required. Opti-mile allows users\nto customise trip parameters such as maximum walking distance, and acceptable\nfare range. We analyse the transit network of New Delhi, evaluating the\nefficiency, feasibility and advantages of opti-mile for optimal multi-modal\ntrips between randomly selected source-destination pairs. We demonstrate that\nopti-mile trips lead to a 10% reduction in distance travelled for 18% increase\nin price compared to traditional shortest paths.

            "reference_abstract": "Telescope Array (TA) is the largest ultrahigh energy cosmic-ray (UHECR)\nobservatory in the Northern Hemisphere. It explores the origin of UHECRs by\nmeasuring their energy spectrum, arrival-direction distribution, and mass\ncomposition using a surface detector (SD) array covering approximately 700\nkm$^2$ and fluorescence detector (FD) stations. TA has found evidence for a\ncluster of cosmic rays with energies greater than 57 EeV. In order to confirm\nthis evidence with more data, it is necessary to increase the data collection\nrate.We have begun building an expansion of TA that we call TAx4. In this\npaper, we explain the motivation, design, technical features, and expected\nperformance of the TAx4 SD. We also present TAx4's current status and examples\nof the data that have already been collected."
